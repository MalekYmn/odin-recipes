        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons bacon grease </li>
            <li>1 slice bread</li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
