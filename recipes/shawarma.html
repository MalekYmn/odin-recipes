        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>3 potatoes, cut into fries</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>8 pita breads, split</li>
            <li>1 cup pickled cucumbers</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix vinegar, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon garlic paste, ginger paste, salt, and pepper together in a shallow dish. Add chicken breasts; turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a heavy pot to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fry potatoes in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove chicken breasts from the marinade and cook until browned and no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; slice into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining 1 teaspoon garlic paste with mayonnaise in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread garlic mayonnaise inside pita breads. Fill each pita with French fries, chicken slices, and pickles.</li>
