        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups Durum wheat flour </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>water as needed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, salt and baking powder. Mix in eggs and enough water to make the dough workable. Knead dough until stiff. Roll into ball and cut into quarters. Using 1/4 of the dough at a time, roll flat to about 1/8 inch use flour as needed, top and bottom, to prevent sticking. Peel up and roll from one end to the other. Cut roll into 3/8 inch strips. Noodles should be about 4 to 5 inches long depending on how thin it was originally flattened. Let dry for 1 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Cook like any pasta or, instead of drying first cook it fresh but make sure water is boiling and do not allow to stick. It takes practice to do this right.</li>
